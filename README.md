4th sem ARM-microController lab

1. Develop an embedded C program to display digits 0 to F using Seven segment display interface.
2. Develop an embedded C program to display the messages LIFE and HELP alternately on a 4-digit Seven-segment display Interface.
3. Develop an embedded C program to display the message “dEPt OF CSE” from right to left and left to right on a four digit Seven segment display interface.
4. Develop an embedded C program to rotate the stepper motor by 360° in the clockwise direction and by 180° in the anti- clockwise direction using Stepper motor interface. Introduce suitable delay between successive steps.
5. Develop an embedded C program to read the status of 8 input bits from the Logic Controller Interface and display ‘FF’ if it is even parity bits otherwise display 00. Also display number of 1’s in the input data.
6. Develop an embedded C program to display “Hello World” message on a 2x16 character LCD interface.
7. Develop an embedded C program to generate square and triangular waveforms using the DAC Interface.
